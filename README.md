Project Description:

In this project, i will create a simple machine learning model to predict the species of flowers based on their features. You can use the famous Iris dataset, which contains measurements of four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) for three different species of iris flowers (setosa, versicolor, and virginica). .
